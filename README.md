This is an Open Source project that integrates the Tor® anonymity software into Minecraft.

The point of this is to make it very easy and quick to hide or keep changing your IP **without it affecting anything outside your game**.
 Also, it tries to integrate many of Tor's features that are useful for in-game use in a user-friendly way, which might not be easily/or at all available to use normally, like:
  -  Preventing non-Tor connections in the game.
  -  Using Tor to resolve DNS instead of the system, making it possible to <ins>connect to .onion MC server addresses</ins>.
  -  Easy and quick IP region selection.
  -  Fast IP changing through the control port, without restarting the whole Tor client.

The mod is compatible with **Windows and Linux**.
